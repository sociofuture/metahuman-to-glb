# Stage 02 / 5.7 native-glb — Blender Assemble + ARKit Bake

Headless Blender stage. Imports the per-mesh GLBs from stage 01, bakes
51 ARKit shape keys onto the face mesh from the Sequencer-bake LSE FBX,
propagates those shape keys onto facial-groom card meshes (eyebrows /
mustache / beard), wires up hair-card materials from sidecar textures,
and saves a `.blend` for stage 03.

## Scope (hard rule)

You run this stage's launcher and verify its outputs. Nothing else.

Do **not** modify pipeline code: `stages/*/tools/*.py`, `tools/*.ps1`,
`_config/`, `RUN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. If a script throws or produces wrong
output, surface the actual error to the operator. Silently working
around it (try/except around imports, skipping failed assets, lowering
thresholds) turns a fixable bug into an invisible regression. Do not
touch other stages' contracts, code, or manifest blocks, or other
characters' artifacts.

## Inputs

| Source | File / Location | Section | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Workspace config | `_config/pipeline.yaml` | `blender_exe` | Blender executable path |
| Character manifest | `characters/<id>/manifest.json` | `character_id` | Identify the character only — DO NOT read or modify other stages' status fields |
| Stage 01 manifest | `characters/<id>/01-glb/mh_manifest.json` | `assets[]`, `arkit_sources`, `sidecar_textures`, `groom_materials` | What to import + ARKit source paths + groom MI params |
| Stage 01 GLBs | `characters/<id>/01-glb/*.glb` | all | Per-mesh geometry + textures (no morphs in this pass) |
| Stage 01 LSE FBX | `characters/<id>/01-glb/LS_arkit_full.fbx` | full | Mesh + skeleton + per-pose bone keyframes — the ARKit shape-key source |
| Stage 01 pose list | `characters/<id>/01-glb/arkit_pose_names.json` | full | Maps frame N → ARKit pose name |
| Stage 01 textures | `characters/<id>/01-glb/textures/*.png` | hair / brow / lash atlases | Wired onto reconstructed groom materials |

## Preconditions (file existence only)

Verify the following files exist on disk before running. Do **not** read
prior-stage `status` fields from the manifest — manifest state can be
stale; files on disk are ground truth:

- `characters/<id>/01-glb/mh_manifest.json`
- `characters/<id>/01-glb/LS_arkit_full.fbx` (must be > 5 MB)
- `characters/<id>/01-glb/arkit_pose_names.json`

If any input is missing, abort with an actionable message ("stage 01
output missing: <path> — run stage 01 first"). Do **not** attempt to
fix or retroactively mark other stages' status.

## Process

1. Read `_config/pipeline.yaml` to learn `blender_exe`.
2. Invoke launcher: `tools/run_assemble.ps1 -Char <id>`. It resolves
   `blender_exe` from `_config/pipeline.yaml` and runs:
   ```
   <blender_exe> --background --python <abs>/tools/import_glb.py -- --char <id> --workspace <abs pipeline root>
   ```
3. Launcher blocks until Blender exits. Exit code must be 0.
4. The script does (in order):
   - Import every GLB listed in `mh_manifest.assets[]` into a clean scene.
   - Hide non-LOD0 / collision meshes.
   - Merge the body-family Armature objects in the scene into one
     skeleton (`_merge_armatures`): body and each outfit piece each
     arrive with their own copy of the body joint hierarchy as a
     separate Armature object, even though bone names are identical
     (same underlying body skeleton). Left unmerged, posing one armature
     (e.g. the body) leaves meshes bound to a different armature
     object — most visibly clothing — stuck in bind pose while the body
     moves. The `*BodyMesh*` armature is kept as canonical; every other
     armature whose bone-name set is a full subset of it (in practice
     the outfit pieces) is repointed — every mesh's Armature modifier +
     object parent onto the canonical armature (vertex groups are
     already keyed by bone name, so no reweighting is needed) — and the
     duplicate armature is deleted. The face armature is deliberately
     NOT merged in: MH's facial rig (~875 bones: core spine/neck/head +
     hundreds of RigLogic corrective joints) is a different skeleton
     from the body rig, not a superset of it (confirmed on a real
     export — it lacks the entire leg/foot chain and even `Root`), so
     forcing it into the same armature would risk silently-wrong pose
     propagation on name-collision bones rather than just staying
     separate. Any armature that isn't a clean subset is left alone and
     logged loudly.
   - Bake 51 ARKit shape keys onto the face mesh via
     `_bake_arkit_from_lse_fbx`: import LSE FBX, scrub frame N for pose N
     (1:1 mapping at 24fps bake), capture deformed mesh via
     `evaluated_get(depsgraph)`, transfer to the GLB face by kdtree
     position match (max=0.00mm; same UE SKM, same topology, perfect
     vertex correspondence).
   - Propagate the face's ARKit shape keys onto groom card meshes
     (`Eyebrows_*`, `Mustache_*`, `Beard_*`, `Stubble_*`, …) via k=4
     inverse-distance² weighting in world space (see
     `_apply_arkit_to_grooms`). Eyelashes are NOT a separate mesh — they
     live as a material slot on the face mesh and inherit shape keys
     for free.
   - Reconstruct hair-card / eyebrow / lash materials using sidecar
     atlases + groom MI params (`_wire_card_materials`).
   - Tune invisible MH face slots (eyeShell, M_Hide, lacrimal, saliva)
     to fully transparent Principled BSDF so they don't paint over
     irises.
   - Parent hair-card StaticMeshes (hair, eyebrows, beard, mustache) to
     the face armature's `head` BONE specifically (`bpy.ops.object.
     parent_set(type='BONE')`, not object-level parenting) so they track
     the head bone's own pose, not just the armature object's root
     transform. Falls back to object-level parenting (root motion only)
     if no `head` bone is found on the armature.
   - Emit `mh_materials.json` (used by stage 04 viewer for hair / lash
     shader injection).
5. Verify outputs (Outputs table). Required: `<id>.blend`, `mh_materials.json`,
   `blend_manifest.json`.
6. Update `characters/<id>/manifest.json` — **only** the
   `stages.02_blender_assemble` block. Do not read, modify, or "fix"
   any other stage's status, timestamps, or errors. The dispatcher
   (Opus) owns those fields:
   - `stages.02_blender_assemble.status = "done"` on success
   - `stages.02_blender_assemble.started_at = <ISO timestamp at launch>`
   - `stages.02_blender_assemble.completed_at = <ISO timestamp at finish>`
   - `stages.02_blender_assemble.errors = []`
7. On failure: `stages.02_blender_assemble.status = "failed"`, append
   actionable message to `stages.02_blender_assemble.errors[]`, leave
   artifacts in place. Still touch only this stage's block.

## Outputs

| Artifact | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Assembled blend | `characters/<id>/02-blend/<id>.blend` | All meshes imported; non-LOD0 hidden; face mesh + groom cards have 51 ARKit shape keys; hair-card materials reconstructed from sidecar atlases. |
| Material spec | `characters/<id>/02-blend/mh_materials.json` | Schema matches 5.6/cinematic so stage 04's viewer.js handles hair / lash injection without changes. |
| Scene manifest | `characters/<id>/02-blend/blend_manifest.json` | Machine-readable summary: imported count, mesh names, armature names, hair_parented count. |
| Updated char manifest | `characters/<id>/manifest.json` | `stages.02_blender_assemble` fields |

## Why bake ARKit shape keys here (not in UE)

Stage 01 has the LSE FBX with bone keyframes that resolve RigLogic.
This stage replays that animation in Blender, captures deformed mesh
per frame, and writes them as static morph targets on the GLB face.
That's the only path that round-trips bone-driven ARKit motion into
glTF morph targets (UE GLTFExporter can't bake animation to morphs;
FBX morph keyframes don't round-trip cleanly).

The kdtree match is `0.00mm` because the LSE FBX face mesh and the GLB
face mesh come from the same UE SkeletalMesh — same topology, same
vertex count (34657). UV-seam vertices land at identical positions
across both export formats; the kdtree just lets us map between the two
exporters' arbitrary vertex orderings without assuming index equality.

## Why the groom prop is k=4 inverse-distance²

Ported from 5.6/cinematic apply_arkit52_grooms.py. k=1 (nearest vert)
pops at seams; k=8 over-smooths and kills corner definition. With
inverse-distance² weights, a groom vert sitting on a face vert (d≈0)
gets ~100% of that face vert's delta; a vert drifting between two face
verts gets a clean blend.

Eyebrows_* card mesh has ~6429 verts sitting ~1.6mm avg from the face
surface. Real ARKit shapes activate ~46 of the 51 keys on the eyebrow
card (5 are skipped because all-zero in the brow region — jawForward,
mouthFunnel, etc.).

## Idempotency

Unconditional overwrite of `characters/<id>/02-blend/`. No prior-state
read. Re-running is safe.

## Failure modes (known)

- `mh_manifest.json` missing → stage 01 hasn't run. Ask operator.
- LSE FBX missing → stage 01 didn't produce it. Check stage 01 logs for
  `Sequencer bake exception`.
- LSE FBX import produces no MESH → file corrupted or empty bake. Check
  file size (~46 MB expected).
- kdtree match max > 5mm → LSE face and GLB face came from different
  SKM builds. Re-run stage 01 to get a consistent pair.
- Log line `skeleton merge: SKIP '<armature>' (...): N bone(s) not present
  in canonical skeleton` → that armature was NOT merged into the body
  skeleton. Expected and harmless for the face armature (by design, see
  `_merge_armatures`). If it fires for an OUTFIT piece instead, that
  outfit's bone set genuinely diverges from the body skeleton (not just
  a naming mismatch) — check the UE asset for a custom/non-standard
  skeleton before assuming this is a pipeline bug. It will still detach
  when the body is re-posed until that's resolved.
- Log line `skeleton merge: no '*BodyMesh*' armature found; falling back
  to most-bones heuristic` → the scene's armature naming doesn't match
  the expected `SKM_<char>_BodyMesh` pattern (stage 01 renamed it, or
  this character has no body mesh). The most-bones fallback may pick the
  face armature as canonical, which is very likely wrong — check why the
  body armature wasn't found before trusting the merge result.
