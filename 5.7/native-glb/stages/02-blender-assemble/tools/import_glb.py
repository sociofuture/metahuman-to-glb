"""
Stage 02 / UE 5.7 Native GLB — import stage 01's per-mesh .glb files into
a single Blender scene.

Unlike the FBX-based pipelines, we do NOT rebuild skin/eye shaders here.
UE's glTF exporter has already baked each MetaHuman material's BaseColor
/ Normal / ORM / Scatter outputs into PNG textures embedded in each
.glb, so the materials round-trip as Principled BSDF with the right
textures wired to the right inputs. Stage 02's job is just:

  1. Load each .glb into the scene.
  2. Mark non-LOD0 / collision meshes hidden (keeps the downstream
     GLB export lean).
  3. Hair-card StaticMeshes get parented to the face skeleton's head
     bone so they track head motion.

Later stages (03 GLB export, 04 webview) work unchanged from cinematic.

Usage:

def _merge_armatures():
    """Merge compatible ARMATURE objects in the scene into one skeleton.

    UE exports each SkeletalMesh (body, face, and every outfit/clothing
    piece) as its own .glb, and each one carries its OWN copy of its
    joint hierarchy as a separate Armature object. Blender's Armature
    *modifier* binds a mesh to one specific Armature OBJECT, not to
    bones by name across objects, so posing e.g. the body armature only
    moves meshes whose modifier points at that object — clothing bound
    to a different (but bone-for-bone identical) armature object stays
    in bind pose and visibly detaches. This is the root cause reported
    after re-posing the body skeleton: the outfit not following.

    IMPORTANT: MH's face armature is NOT a superset of the body
    armature and can't be safely unioned with it here — confirmed by
    inspecting a real export: the face rig (~875 bones: core spine/neck
    /head chain + hundreds of RigLogic facial-corrective joints) is
    missing the entire leg/foot chain the body rig has (it doesn't even
    have a `Root` bone), while the body/outfit rig doesn't have the
    facial correctives. They're related-but-different skeletons that
    happen to share some bone names, not one containing the other. A
    naive merge would silently produce duplicate/renamed bones on name
    collisions (e.g. two `head` bones) with correct-looking geometry but
    WRONG pose propagation — worse than leaving them separate. So this
    only merges the body-family armatures (body + outfits, which really
    are the same skeleton bone-for-bone): pick the `*BodyMesh*` armature
    as canonical, verify every other armature's bone-name set is a
    subset of it (glTF vertex groups are already keyed by bone name, so
    once a mesh's modifier points at the canonical armature its existing
    vertex groups just work — no reweighting needed), repoint every
    mesh's Armature modifier + object parent at the canonical armature,
    and delete the now-redundant duplicates. Anything that isn't a
    subset (the face armature, by design) is left alone and logged."""

    from the MH-baked Texture2D assets (`tex_dict`, e.g.
    `mh_manifest["face_skin_textures"]` / `["body_skin_textures"]`),
    dropping whatever GLTFExporter's material bake produced.
    `material_predicate(lowercased_material_name)` selects which
    material to rebuild; `label` is just for log lines.

    Why: GLTFExporter's USE_MESH_DATA bake renders these materials'
    enormous multi-layer shader graphs (static + animated wrinkle/
    colormap layers, plus a KHR_materials_specular extension) through
    an offscreen pass, and that pass comes out visibly blurry
    regardless of the bake's target resolution — confirmed by directly
    exporting the same materials' "Basecolor Baked"/"Normal Baked"
    Texture2D assets (stage 01's `_export_baked_skin_sidecar`) and
    finding them sharp, full detail (the face's Normal asset is
    8192x8192 with clearly defined wrinkles/pores; the body's Normal
    is 8192x8192 too, with garment-seam and skin surface detail).
    Confirmed on both materials — same architecture, same bug.

    Two more targeted approaches were tried and abandoned before this
    (on the face material first): mutating the existing Base Color/
    Normal image nodes' `.image` in place, and replacing just those
    two nodes while leaving the rest of the imported graph (Occlusion,
    the KHR_materials_specular specularTexture, etc.) intact. Both hit
    the same Blender glTF-exporter internal bug ("This case should not
    happen, please report a bug") on export, and the material shipped
    with NO baseColorTexture/normalTexture in the resulting glTF at
    all — the exporter's node-graph-to-glTF-slot heuristic apparently
    gets confused by *something* in that original imported graph once
    it's disturbed, not specifically by which node we touch. Clearing
    the material and rebuilding a plain, minimal Principled BSDF (same
    pattern already used elsewhere in this file for hair-card and
    invisible-slot materials) sidesteps the whole graph rather than
    trying to coexist with it. We lose the Occlusion/Specular maps and
    the KHR_materials_specular extension these materials used to
    carry, which is an acceptable trade for skin that isn't blurry.

    The Normal image is raw UE-authored data (DirectX green-channel
    convention), unlike GLTFExporter's own bake output which the
    codebase elsewhere assumes is already GL-convention — tagged with
    `_normal_` in its name so stage 03's `_is_normal_image` name
    heuristic recognizes it and applies the DX->GL G-flip."""

    01 dumps:

      - PNGs of `/Game/<char>/Grooms/Textures/` (the data atlases —
        Attribute and RootUVSeedCoverage)
      - MI param dict per groom MaterialInstance (hairMelanin etc.)

    For each hair-card mesh we:

      1. Look up the matching MI (by name pattern Hair_S_Coil_CardsMesh
         -> MI_WI_Hair_S_Coil_Hair_Cards) and synthesize a Base Color
         from its hairMelanin / hairRedness / hairDye params.
      2. Load the Attribute atlas as Non-Color, split channels:
         R -> Alpha (strand cutout)
         B -> root-darkening factor (multiplied into Base Color via a
              color ramp that holds tips at 1.0 and roots at 0.35).
      3. Use HASHED alpha so thin strands antialias correctly.

    The 5.6 cinematic pipeline already produces proper full-deformation
    ARKit shape keys (joints + morphs + correctives baked as static

    that's reachable from Python without Maya, so for the same character
    we transplant 5.6's shape keys onto 5.7's GLB face mesh by
    position-matched kdtree.

    Steps:
      1. Append `Ada_FaceMesh_LOD0` from the 5.6 ada.blend.
      2. Compute world-space basis positions on both meshes; align the
         centroids (5.6 character is at z~1.45m, 5.7 at z~1.58m).
      3. KDTree-match each GLB vertex to the closest 5.6 source vertex
         in centered world-aligned space.
      4. For each of the 52 shape keys on the source, transfer per-vertex
         deltas through the index map, with the world->local conversion
         that handles the source's 0.01 import scale vs the GLB's 1.0.
      5. Threshold: vertices > ARKIT_MATCH_THRESHOLD_M from any source
         vertex receive a zero delta (protects topology-misaligned
         regions like teeth interior, eye sockets).
      6. Drop the appended 5.6 source mesh + armature + grooms.

    Frame N corresponds to pose_names[N]. We:

      1. Load the face FBX into a scratch armature/mesh.
      2. Load the AnimSequence FBX onto the same armature.
      3. For each frame, set the scene to that frame, force a depsgraph
         update, then `shape_key_add(from_mix=True)` on the imported
         mesh. The new key captures the composed deformation from
         that frame's morph weights + bone transforms.
      4. Rename the new key to pose_names[N].
      5. Strip the 858 raw shape keys (we keep only the named poses).
      6. Transfer those shape keys onto the GLB face mesh by vertex
         order (FBX and GLB come from the same UE SkeletalMesh data
