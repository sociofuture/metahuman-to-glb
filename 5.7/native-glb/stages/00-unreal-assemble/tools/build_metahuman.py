"""
Drive the 5.7 MetaHuman build lifecycle on an existing MetaHumanCharacter
asset by pumping the editor's tick loop rather than blocking Python:

  try_add_object_to_edit
  request_texture_sources      (async, Epic cloud)
  <wait for can_build_meta_human>
  build_meta_human             (sync)
  <write status file>

Meant to be invoked on Editor STARTUP (not commandlet — ticks don't run
there and the texture downloads will stall). The shell wrapper launches
UnrealEditor.exe with -ExecCmds="py <this> -- --asset=... --status=...".

Status file transitions: STARTING -> REQUESTED -> WAITING -> BUILDING
-> DONE | FAILED. External poller reads it to know when to stop.

    Subtle differences vs. UE's MH shader are easy to introduce and
